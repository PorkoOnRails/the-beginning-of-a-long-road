I'm Porko and this is my long road of coding, I trying as much to do a useless program just for fun
in the beginning I'll user JavaScript to do the codes but my goal is to learn a bit of each one
and if nobody notice yet I'm leaning english as well
The languagues that I'm interested to learn is
* JavaScript
* Python
* C++
as the time goes I'll have to learn some others like HTML and CSS because of the JavaScript but I'mm not afraid to learn as much as I can
in resume this project is to save the trash codes that I made and see in the future my improve (or not)!
Hope one day became a senior at least in one of them!
